# Specops Sully

## Description:
After playing so many hours of TnH I've noticed that it's now missing that tactical and shooting range feel I really loved at the beginning.
With that in mind I started designing this character:
 - to punish careless players, such as myself
 - to challenge even the best players, by catching them between a rock and a hard place. Next time, plan ahead dumdum
 - make those shooting challenges much harder, thanks to crazier encryption combinations
 - make player under more constant pressure by using a steady stream of fewer enemies during holds
 - make consumables not only useful, but a tool you have to use. Who normally uses non health weinies or grenades? <sub>lol<sub> 
 - give a taste of how fun and engaging limited ammo is for people not accustomed to it. Spawnlock is just as hard, but you have unlimited pistol ammo
 
##### NOTE: For the optimal experience while using Spawnlock, only Spawnlock the starting pistols magazine.
 
```
This is the real tactical experience
Welcome to the eye of the storm
Good luck, you'll need it
Osa out.
```

## Progression changes:
- Removed all useless types of shells, now shotguns will always feel useful and no longer you're forced to pray to rng gods for usable ammo
- Patrols are abundant and powerful, you can try to fight them for some health drops, but you will lose ammo and probably even more health, ignoring them is much harder now.
- Supply points now have turrets, making them much harder to access. Explosions are great for clearing them out
- Holds now also have turrets. No more you're just free to run in and slap "Start the Hold" to clear everything without even losing hp
- Each supply now has a free cache, you can get loads of useful things, get creative! You have to now...
- Attachments are now cheaper and you no longer waste hp from crates, there are no tokens inside. Two really great ideas, stolen from AllRounderRandy by Jessica

## Bugs:
 - Turrets can, and will spawn knocked down
 - I'm not sure how often the Ammo Purchase panel will spawn, it should be common enough, needs more playtesting.
 - On some maps, patrols like to congregate in small areas (Promeatus middle area is, I think, the worst offender for that)
 - If you dont like the "only Spawnlock the starting pistols magazine" rule, you can go ahead and play your way! Just have fun! <sub>I don't care... <sub> <sub><sup>I do care...<sub><sup>

## TODO:
- During holds, sosigs have a chance to drop a starting pistol magazine, no longer you're f'ed/have to use sosiguns when you're out of ammo during holds. This decision also makes limited ammo runs easier, due to lack of "Infinite Ammo Stations".
add new sosig template that drops mags sometimes during holds.
    - MagazineG17Standard 17.0
    - MagazineG19_19rnd 19.0
    - MagazineM1911Tactical 11.0
    - MagazineM1911 7.0

- Endless mode:     (aka. "Game doesn't like you" mode)
    - you start with more tokens to spend, gives a chance for a good start
    - only single health crate in supply points
    - 5 rotations, each with different combination of turrets and enemies
    - Patrols have lower chance to drop health
    - EVEN CRAZIER encryption combinations

- Longer melee weapons now, not only enable you to save ammo, but now you can also safely knock over turrets with it.
    - add longer/better melee category in tools

- Later holds will have more supply points
    - do this pls
    
- Thumbnail pls?
    - :3

##Future plans
We get lots of new weapons, great maps, but lately, character scene has been quiet. I'm gonna change that! Here are few characters that are coming, soon or later:
- **Meatceiver Matt** (collecting single bullets from ground will be fun, surely...)
- **Ripper Ryan** (decimate HORDES, with TOO MUCH FIREPOWER! Set your pc ON FIRE!)
- **Ghostly Gunther** (No hp drops at all. YOU GET NOTHING, and then YOU LOSE)
- **Gambler Garry** (Wanna test your luck? Will you get a desert eagle or a makarov, an antimatter rifle or just a .22 shooter. Each category contains WHOLE CLASS in it.)
